# Synthesizer
This project aims to build a synthesizer in C++. Our coarse plan could be defined as follows:
  - Experimentation: learn from youtube, blogs and books the best methods for sound generation. 
  - Create a small synthesizer in a PC which can generate several notes simultaneously and vary the timber, and something to play drums. 
  - Export the project to a RaspberryPi to make it cooler. With lasers, smoke and all the fish. 
  
### Directory Organization
  - exp: includes all the experimentation and tests. Maybe some tests in Matlab/Python. 
  - src: contains the source code of the synthesizer (including unit testing).
  - doc: contains reference to useful resources and behavioural description of the project.
  - build: the compiler's build files
  - tools: such as scripts to play a given waveform or Fourier transform of a given noise.
  - bin: compiled exe goes here (or note very smart?)
  - config: who know if some configuration files will be needed.
  
### Brainstorming
  - Come on! Include your random ideas for the project within this list.
