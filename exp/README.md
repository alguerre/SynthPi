  - First attempt to play a waveform using SDL library.
  

###  3.embedded_systems_project 
  - Project carried out during the embedded systems course in my master studies. 
  - It uses SDL_mixer to play some predefined sounds. It was created to be run on a Raspberry Pi where:
    - wiringPi library is used for threading, i2c, interruptions, ...
    - the note is selected according to the distance of an object to the sensor
    - drums are played with buttons
    - a LED panel shows a different combination according to the playing music.
