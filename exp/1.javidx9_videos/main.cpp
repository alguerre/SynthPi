/*
This code is part of the experimentation process to learn how to build a
synthesizer using C++.

Goals of this code:
    - Play with the code of javidx9.
    - Learn basics on sounds generation.
    - Study C++.
    - Understand the library olcNoiseMaker.h by javidx9.
    - Create a basic prototype of synthesizer.
